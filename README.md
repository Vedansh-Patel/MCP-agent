# 🌦️ MCP Weather Agent

A lightweight weather agent powered by [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/mcp-org/mcp), fetching real-time alerts and forecasts from the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) API.

## 🚀 Features

- 📍 Retrieve 5-period detailed forecasts for any U.S. latitude/longitude
- ⚠️ Get active weather alerts by U.S. state code (e.g. CA, TX)

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🧪 Usage

```
